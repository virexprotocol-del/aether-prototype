# Aether Prototype v0

This is the first living prototype of Aether — a minimal identity + incentive loop showing human–AI co-evolution.

## How it works
- Human inputs signal
- AI responds based on internal state and motivation
- Human gives feedback (reward)
- AI updates state
- Evolution trace is logged

## Run it
python run.py

## Why it matters
This prototype demonstrates the core architecture of Aether: identity + incentive → emergence.

Built entirely from a phone, under constraint, with clarity and inevitability.
